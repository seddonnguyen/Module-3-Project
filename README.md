We used Ruby version 2.6.1 and [lite-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lite-server).

Make sure to run ```bundle install```, ```rails db:create```, ```rails db:migrate``` and ```rails db:seed``` before running the app. 

To run the app, type ```rails s``` into the command line from the backend folder. Next, type ```lite-server``` into the command line from the frontend folder. You should be up and running!

Offer Hub is an app where users can sell/buy items -- Similar to craigslist, Offer Hub differentiates itself by allowing users to leave comments.

We used Ruby version 2.6.1

Make sure to run ```bundle install```, ```rails db:create```, ```rails db:migrate``` and ```rails db:seed``` before running the app. 
To run the app, type ```rails s``` into your command line from the backend folder and type ```lite-server``` into your command line from the frontend folder. You should be up and running!
